HOW TO PLAY

Use the arrow keys to move your character around the board.

Move into rocks to push them in the direction you are heading. Rocks cannot be moved into the bottom row.

WATCH OUT FOR BUGS

If a bug hits your character, the game will be reset.

OBJECT OF THE GAME

To win, you must fill up the top row with rocks. Pushing a rock into the highlighted tile will cause a
new rock to spawn. There can only be 5 rocks on the board at one time.

Good Luck!
